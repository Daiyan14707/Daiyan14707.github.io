        <h1>Benefits of Coffee</h1>
        <span>
          Your brew gives you benefits beyond an energy boost. Here are the top
          ways coffee can positively impact your health:
        </span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>You could live longer.</li>
          <p>
            Recent studies found that coffee drinkers are less likely to die
            from some of the leading causes of death in women: coronary heart
            disease, stroke, diabetes and kidney disease.
          </p>
          <br />
          <li>Your body may process glucose (or sugar) better.</li>
          <p>
            That’s the theory behind studies that found that people who drink
            more coffee are less likely to get type 2 diabetes.
          </p>
          <br />
          <li>You're less likely to develop heart failure.</li>
          <p>
            Drinking one to two cups of coffee a day may help ward off heart
            failure, when a weakened heart has difficulty pumping enough blood
            to the body.
          </p>
          <br />
          <li>You are less likely to develop Parkinson's disease.</li>
          <p>
            Caffeine is not only linked to a lower chance of developing
            Parkinson’s disease, but it may also help those with the condition
            better control their movements.
          </p>
          <br />
          <li>Your liver will thank you.</li>
          <p>
            Both regular and decaf coffee seem to have a protective effect on
            your liver. Research shows that coffee drinkers are more likely to
            have liver enzyme levels within a healthy range than people who
            don’t drink coffee.
          </p>
          <br />
          <li>Your DNA will be stronger.</li>
          <p>
            Dark roast coffee decreases breakage in DNA strands, which occur
            naturally but can lead to cancer or tumors if not repaired by your
            cells.
          </p>
          <br />
          <li>Your odds of getting colon cancer will go way down.</li>
          <p>
            One in 23 women develop colon cancer. But researchers found that
            coffee drinkers — decaf or regular — were 26 percent less likely to
            develop colorectal cancer.
          </p>
          <br />
          <li>You may decrease your risk of getting Alzheimer's disease.</li>
          <p>
            Almost two-thirds of Americans living with Alzheimer’s disease are
            women. But the caffeine in two cups of coffee may provide
            significant protection against developing the condition. In fact,
            researchers found that women age 65 and older who drank two to three
            cups of coffee a day were less likely to develop dementia in
            general.
          </p>
          <br />
          <li>You're not as likely to suffer a stroke.</li>
          <p>
            For women, drinking at least one cup of coffee a day is associated
            with lowered stroke risk, which is the fourth leading cause of death
            in women.
          </p>

        <h1>Types of Coffee Beans</h1>
        <span>The 4 Different Types of Coffee Beans:</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <ol>
          <li>Arabica Coffee Beans (Coffea arabica)</li>
          <p>
            Most gourmet coffee brands advertise that they use 100% Arabica
            beans. Why? Arabica coffee beans are considered the most
            high-quality variety. They’re known for their smooth, complex flavor
            and distinct lack of bitterness.
          </p>
          <br />
          <li>Robusta Coffee Beans (Coffea caniphora)</li>
          <p>
            Many people think that Robusta coffee is harsher and more bitter. It
            often has a strong smell and a somewhat flat, almost burnt taste.
            Robusta beans also have significantly more caffeine than Arabica
            beans.
          </p>
          <br />
          <li>Liberica Coffee Beans (Coffea liberica)</li>
          <p>
            Among enthusiasts, Liberica coffee has a controversial and
            polarizing reputation for wild inconsistency. Those who’ve tried
            this rare variety either love it or hate it. Some coffee drinkers
            adore the unusual, nutty, woody flavor and sneaky backbite on the
            finish. Others compare the flavor to burnt garbage.
          </p>
          <br />
          <li>Excelsa Coffee Beans (Coffea excelsa)</li>
          <p>
            In terms of flavor, Excelsa beans are pretty unique. They combine
            light roast traits like tart notes and fruity flavors with flavors
            that are more reminiscent of dark roasts. They’re also lighter on
            aroma and caffeine — while maintaining an unusual depth of flavor.
            You can sometimes find these unusual beans in blends because they
            add complexity.
          </p>

        <p>
          When you try your coffee, taste it thoughtfully. Smell it. Hold a sip
          in your mouth. Slurp it to splash coffee on the back of your palate.
          Exhale as you swallow. See if the flavour conjures any memories or
          reminds you of something you’ve tasted before. This is one of the joys
          of high-quality coffee.
